# Exercise: Setting up GitHub Copilot

## Objective
Configure GitHub Copilot in your development environment and test that it's working correctly.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account (free or paid)
- Visual Studio Code installed

## Time Estimate
10-15 minutes

## Instructions

### Step 1: Verify GitHub Access
1. Sign in to your GitHub account
2. Navigate to https://github.com/features/copilot
3. Check if you have access to GitHub Copilot
   - If not, consider signing up for a trial or subscription

### Step 2: Install Copilot in VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
4. Click "Install"
5. After installation, click "Sign in to GitHub"
6. Complete the authentication process

### Step 3: Test Copilot
1. Create a new file named `test.js`
2. Type the following comment and press Enter:
```javascript
// Function to calculate the fibonacci sequence up to n terms
```
3. Wait for Copilot to suggest code
4. Press Tab to accept the suggestion
5. Test other comments to see what Copilot generates

## Expected Outcome
You should have GitHub Copilot successfully installed and providing code suggestions based on your comments.

## Tips
- If you don't see suggestions, check that Copilot is enabled in VS Code settings
- Try typing function signatures to see how Copilot implements them
- Comments provide important context for Copilot's suggestions

## Challenge (Optional)
Try using Copilot to implement a sorting algorithm by just providing appropriate comments and function signatures.
