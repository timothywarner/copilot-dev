# Exercise 1: First Steps with GitHub Copilot

## Objective
Learn how to interact with GitHub Copilot through basic prompts and understand its suggestion system.

## Tasks

### 1. Basic Function Creation
Create a new file called `calculator.py` and use Copilot to help you write:
- A function to add two numbers
- A function to multiply two numbers
- Input validation for both functions

### 2. Documentation Generation
Add docstrings to your functions using Copilot:
- Type `"""` and let Copilot suggest documentation
- Ensure parameters and return types are documented
- Add usage examples in the docstring

### 3. Test Case Creation
Create test cases for your functions:
- Write comments describing what you want to test
- Let Copilot generate the test cases
- Include edge cases and error conditions

### 4. Error Handling
Add error handling to your functions:
- Handle invalid inputs
- Add appropriate error messages
- Create custom exceptions if needed

## Tips
1. Start with clear comments describing what you want
2. Use natural language in your comments
3. Try different variations of prompts
4. Pay attention to Copilot's suggestions
5. Use Tab to accept suggestions

## Expected Output
Your final code should:
- Have well-documented functions
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Have a complete test suite
- Follow Python best practices

## Bonus Challenge
Add more calculator functions:
- Division with zero handling
- Power function with validation
- Square root with domain validation
