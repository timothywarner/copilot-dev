# Copilot Markdown Linting Custom Instruction

To ensure high-quality, readable Markdown in enterprise projects, always auto-lint Markdown files with Copilot. Focus on:

- **Consistent spacing:** Insert a blank line between headings, paragraphs, lists, and code blocks for clarity.
- **List formatting:** Add a blank line before and after lists. Ensure list items are properly indented and spaced.
- **Code blocks:** Surround code blocks with blank lines. Use triple backticks for fenced code blocks.
- **Headings:** Place a blank line before and after headings.
- **Tables:** Add a blank line before and after tables for separation.

**Copilot Usage Tip:**
Prompt Copilot to "lint this markdown for spacing and formatting best practices" before committing changes.
